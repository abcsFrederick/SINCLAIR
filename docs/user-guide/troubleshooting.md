# Troubleshooting

## Recommended steps to troubleshoot the pipeline

### Email

Check your email for an email regarding pipeline failure. You will receive an email from slurm@biowulf.nih.gov with the subject: Slurm Job_id=[#] Name=CARLISLE Failed, Run time [time], FAILED, ExitCode 1

### Review the log files

Review the logs in two ways:

1. Review the master slurm file: This file will be found in the `/path/to/results/dir/` and titled `slurm-[jobid].out`. Reviewing this file will tell you what rule errored, and for any local SLURM jobs, provide error details
2. Review the individual rule log files: After reviewing the master slurm-file, review the specific rules that failed within the `/path/to/results/dir/logs/`. Each rule will include a `.err` and `.out` file, with the following formatting: `{rulename}.{masterjobID}.{individualruleID}.{wildcards from the rule}.{out or err}`

### Restart the run

After addressing the issue, unlock the output directory, perform another dry-run and check the status of the pipeline, then resubmit to the cluster.

```
sinclair run \
    -profile biowulf \
    --input assets/input_manifest.csv \
    --contrast assets/contrast_manifest.csv \
    --output /data/$USER/scRNA_test \
    -params-file assets/params.yml
```

## If a process runs out of resources

You can change the resources allocated to processes by changing them in `conf/base.config`.

Here is an alternate version of the `process_high` label that allocates more resources and uses the `largemem` partition:

```
    withLabel:process_high {
        cpus   = { check_max( 48                   , 'cpus'    ) }
        memory = { check_max( 500.GB * task.attempt, 'memory' ) }
        time   = { check_max( 72.h                 , 'time'    ) }
        queue = 'largemem'
        clusterOptions = ' --gres=lscratch:750 '
    }
```
